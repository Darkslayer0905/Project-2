  For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

 That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? You don't know how to do any of those.

 And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I'm Santa Claus! Large bet on myself in round one.

 I just told you! You've killed me!
