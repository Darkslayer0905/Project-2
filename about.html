  For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? You don't know how to do any of those.

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I'm Santa Claus! Large bet on myself in round one.

I just told you! You've killed me!

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be fearedâ€¦
Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
